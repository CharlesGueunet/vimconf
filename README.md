__INSTALL__
-----------

### Core

After backing up the old _.vimrc_ file.

```bash
  cd ~
  git clone --recursive https://github.com/CharlesGueunet/vimconf.git .vimmic
  ln -sf .vimmic/.vimrc .
```

The name *.vimmic/*  is given as example, this configuration will use the symbolic link
to find the configuration folder.<br/>

Additional features available if:<br/>
* Vim has Python support
* Ctags is installed (Consider [Universal Ctags](https://github.com/universal-ctags), a more up-to-date project)

### Python

For Python users, the [flake8-vim](https://github.com/andviro/flake8-vim)
plugin might require the [flake8](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flake8) Python
package. To install it, you can use :

```bash
pip install --user flake8
```

You need to intall this package for the version of python you use.

### Update

Their is a command in Vim to update all plugins:
```vim
:Update
```

### Neovim

For those who would like to try with [neovim](https://neovim.io/): [source](https://neovim.io/doc/user/nvim.html#nvim-from-vim)
```bash
mkdir -p ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:=$HOME/.config}
ln -s ~/.vim $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvim
ln -s ~/.vimrc $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvim/init.vim
```

__USE__
-------

* The default Leader Key is ",".
* You can press ; instead of :
* If you want persistant undo (survive vim restart) create a **.undodir/** folder in the Vimmic installation folder.
* If you want to display saved session at Vim startup, save them in **sessions/** folder in the Vimmic installation folder.

We recommand to read the Vimmic configurations files (Next section) as they are well documented.<br/>
Click [here](Keymap.md) for Plugins mapping.
And   [here](Config.md) for Plugins configuration (short).

__STRUCTURE__

__INSPIRATION__
----------------

This configuration have started by a look at
[spf13](https://github.com/spf13/spf13-vim), another vim distribution.
spf13 is great but heavy so I decided to make my own configuration much lighter.

For the navigation and some highlight, I used advices of
[this post](http://nvie.com/posts/how-i-boosted-my-vim/)

Lots of idea where taken from the
[jetbrains ide](https://www.jetbrains.com/) wich are among the best ones.

For those who want to use space as the leader key,
[this](https://sheerun.net/2014/03/21/how-to-boost-your-vim-productivity/)
website could be usefull.

For later, build tools and shortcut might come from [this conf](https://github.com/xmementoit/vim-ide.git).

Another great website about vim plugins is [vimawesome](http://vimawesome.com/).

Some tricks about buffer and viml evaluation come from
[this dotfile](https://github.com/thirtythreeforty/dotfiles/blob/cb464b7ef00534aa06247e67f4e55c701022571f/vim/config/mappings.vim#L20-31).
