INSTALL
-------

##*Once you have backed up your old .vim and .vimrc* :

```bash
  cd ~
  git clone --recursive https://github.com/CharlesGueunet/vimconf.git .vim
  ln -sf .vim/.vimrc .
```

If you have already cloned this repo without the --recursive or after each update, use :

```bash
  git submodule update --init
```

To install ctags, look into your distribution repository, or download sources
[here](http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/ctags/ctags-5.8.tar.gz).<br>

For Python users, the [flake8-vim](https://github.com/andviro/flake8-vim)
plugin might require the [flake8](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flake8) Python
package. To install it, you can use :

```bash
   pip install --user flake8
```

##Update :

When you update this configuration you should re-run the submodule update given above.
If you have a warning like :

```
warning: unable to rmdir (ft)bundle/[plugin] : folder is not empty
```

It comes from the submodule architecture. You might and you **should** delete this folder
corresponding to a droped off plugin.

##Neovim :

For those who would like to make a try : [neovim](https://neovim.io/doc/user/nvim_from_vim.html)

```bash
    mkdir -p ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:=$HOME/.config}
    ln -s ~/.vim $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvim
    ln -s ~/.vimrc $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvim/init.vim
```

neovim is fully compatible with vim, so these configuration files works totally.<br>
If you have no color using neovim, check your $TERM. If it is xterm, change it to xterm-256color.

CONFIG
------

## Customize

You can personalize this configuration with two files. The first one is _$HOME/.vimrc.preconf_,
a sample one is given in this git. This files allow you to disable some plugins or default configuration.
You can also define your own leader key.</br>
The second one is _$HOME/.vimrc.postconf_, aimed to contain your own configurations.
Here you can change default plugins configuration and even highlights / colors of you editor.
There is also a sample of this file in the git.

If you want to add custom plugins, you can create a _.vim/ctbundle_ folder and put them in it.
Once again, use the _.vimrc.postconf_ for configuration.<br>

If you think your customizationsmight be usefull for other people, please consider [Contributions](#contrib)

If you want to have a persistant undo create a _$HOME/.undodir_ folder.

To save session and have them at vim startup, create them in _$HOME/.vim/sessions/_

## Additional

* snippets completion:
    If you want to add your own snippets, create a _ctbundle/custom\_snippets/snippets_
    folder and put your snippets in it. The file should be named type.snippets, you have
    a lot of example files in _bundle/vim-snippets/snippets_.

USE
---

 * We assume you know how to use vim
 * The default leader key is ","
 * doc: You can add the doc of all plungins with :
```vim
    :Helptags
```
  (do not confuse with :heltags, made to add  the doc of one plugin!)

## Navigation

 *try to use buffer navigation, cool with [nerdTree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree) (Leader n)*

 * (Leader v) to vertical split
 * (Leader h) to horizontal split
 * (Leader left or right or num) to change buffer
 * (Leader bottom) to list buffers
 * (Leader top) to change buffer
 * (Leader &lt; or &gt;) to change tab
 * (CTRL+ w  arrow) switch windows (split)
 * (Leader o) to maximize/unmaximizer current windows among splitted
 * (Leader b) open ctags menu. Ctags are used to rapidely go to function / variable ...

## Files navigation
 * (Leader n) open NerdTree : file navigator menu
 * (Leader f) open NerdTree on current location

## Text
 * [easy-motion](https://github.com/easymotion/vim-easymotion) allow fast travel to word after cursor (w) or before (b)
     and other traversal. Use (leader leader w/e/...).
 * [vim-surround](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround) is made to help in "surrounding object" manipulation.
     For example you can change 'test' in "test" by pressing cs'" with your curson inside the '. Also works for xml.
 * you can also add surounding object. In visual selection (maj+S {) put the current selection between braces.
 * [vim-over](https://github.com/osyo-manga/vim-over) bring interactive substitution :
   + (Leader s) interactive substitute
   + (Leader r) replace current word
   + in visual mode (Ctrl+R) interactive substitute in current selection only

## Indentation
  * C and C++ can be indented with (Ctrl d) for current block / selection, if you have python support.
     This indentation use [clang-formatter](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html#vim-integration).
     To personalise the output, put a ".clang-format" file in the project root (one is given in example in the git)
  * To align ([tabular](https://github.com/godlygeek/tabular)) text on a given char : :Tab/\<char\> <br>
     shorcut exist for = and : with (Leader a=/a:).
  * You can fold your current scope ('{ ... }') by pressing (Leader -)

## Tips
 * (Leader p) show your current regiser, allowing you to retrieve old pasted lines ("0p for example)
 * you can add [bookmark](https://github.com/MattesGroeger/vim-bookmarks) to a line with "mm"
     and  navigate through bookmarks with "mp" and "mn". Add text to your bookmark with "mi"
 * [undo-tree](https://github.com/mbbill/undotree) give a good view of the vim undotree.
     It is accessible *via* (Leader u). You can also print a diff with the current state with (maj+D) on the node
 * mouse enabled, use maj when selecting text to allow ctrl-maj-c
 * If you don't want Airline to check for indentation/trailling : press F3

## Completion
 * Word completion use JetBrain style : Ctrl-Space.
 * You can use snippets with tab (example : inc<tab> -> #include <| >)
 * When closed you con go out of bracket, string... with (Ctrl+g g)

## Code tips
 * [Syntastic](https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic) can be toogled with F4
    and the error window can be shown with (Leader e).
 * (Leader c space) tooggle comment on the current line/selection.
 * [man-vim](https://github.com/vim-utils/vim-man) show the manual of the word under cursor with (maj+K)
    in command mode. You can also call :Man <function>.
 * \+ and \_ allows to select and expand / shrink the current [region](https://github.com/terryma/vim-expand-region)
 * XML completion: along with a lot of snippets (p, body, ul ...)
    [closetag](https://github.com/alvan/vim-closetag) autocomplete tags: \<toto\> -\> \<toto\>| \</toto\>

## Git
 * (Leader g d) show you the diff of the current hunk
 * (Leader g h) highlight your file with the changes
 * (Leader g r) revert the current hunk to the git state

### [Syntastic](https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic)
 * You can force a silent check with (Leader c) and make the error windows appear with (Leader e)
 * for syntastic to work properly in your project you may need to indicate some files to include or some flags for the compiler.
A sample file for C++ is include here : .syntastic\_cpp\_config.
This file should be next to the source file opened in vim.

INSPIRATION
-----------

This configuration have started by a look at
[spf13](https://github.com/spf13/spf13-vim), another vim distribution.
spf13 is great but heavy so I decided to make my own configuration much lighter.<br>
For the navigation and some highlight, I used advices of
[this post](http://nvie.com/posts/how-i-boosted-my-vim/)<br>
Lots of idea where taken from the
[jetbrains ide](https://www.jetbrains.com/) wich are among the best ones.<br>
For those hwo want to use space as the leader key,
[this](https://sheerun.net/2014/03/21/how-to-boost-your-vim-productivity/)
website could be usefull.<br>
For later, build tools and shortcut might come from [this conf](https://github.com/xmementoit/vim-ide.git).<br>
Another great website about vim plugins is [vimawesome](http://vimawesome.com/).

----------------------------------

### Adding plugins
For consistency, plugins needs to be added as submodule.
If they are gloabls (common to every language) add them in _bundle_.
If they depend on the current FileType, put them on _ftbunle_/\<Language\>.

 ```bash
  git submodule add [git-url]
 ```

ISSUE
-----

For those using neovim, you need the latest build ([here](https://github.com/neovim/neovim)) to avoid a weird overflow of the warning section of airline.
Event with the latest version, you will still have a little bug : the error and warning windows are shown even when empty.<br>
To avoid having to compil your own neovim and the little bug, you can use [this patch](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline/pull/1126/files).
