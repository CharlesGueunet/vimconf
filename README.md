  ln -sf .vim/.vimrc .
```

If you have already cloned this repo without the --recursive you can use :

```bash
  git submodule update --init
```

To install ctags (or choose your distribution version if you can):
```bash
   cd ctags
   ./configure
   make
   sudo make install
```
by default ctags use zsh if it is installed (or bash otherwise)
change syntastic shell to your convenient if needed in the vimrc file.

For Python users, the [flake8-vim](https://github.com/andviro/flake8-vim)
plugin might require the [flake8](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flake8) Python
package. To install it, you can use :

```bash
   pip install --user flake8
```

USE
---

 * We assume you know how to use vim
 * The leader key is ","

## Navigation

 *(try to use buffer navigation, cool with nerdTree ((Leader n))*

 * (Leader v) to vertical split
 * (Leader h) to horizontal split
 * (Leader left or right) to go to the dezired buffer
 * (Leader bottom) to list buffers
 * (Leader top) to change buffer
 * (Leader &lt; or &gt;) to go to desired windows
 * (CTRL+ w  arrow) to go to the dezired windows (split)
 * (Leader o) to maximize/unmaximizer current windows among splitted
 * (Leader b) open ctags menu, allow travel btw functions & variables

## Files navigation
 * (Leader n) open NerdTree : file navigator menu
 * (Leader f) open NerdTree on current location

## Words
 * Fast travel with (Leader Leader w)
 * cs'" to change 'test' in "test" (change surround)
 * in Visual selection : maj+S allow to put surround mark arround the selected block :
     maj+S  {  will sourround the block with {}
 * Interactively replace word under cursor using (Leader r)
 * Interactive substitute (%s) using (Leader s)

## Indent
  * (Leader ig to have indentation guide
  * C and C++ can be indented with (Ctrl d) (current line / selection)
    this indentation use clang formatter. to personalise put
    clang-format file in the project root (one is given in example in the git)
  * To align text on a given char : :Tab/\<char\>
  * Shorcut exist for = and : with (Leader a= (or :a)).
  * You can fold your current scope ('{ ... }') by pressing (Leader -)

## Tips
 * mouse enabled, use maj when selecting text to allow ctrl-maj-c
 * XML autocomplete juste write the body and then tab : p TAB -> \<p\>\</p\>
 Custom tag autocomplete when created : \<toto\> -\> \<toto\>| \</toto\>
 * (Leader p) show your current regiser, allowing you to retrieve old pasted lines ("0p for example)
 * you can add bookmark to a line with "mm" and  navigate through bookmarks with mp and mn
 * Add text to your bookmark with mi

## Completion
 * The completion use JetBrain style : Ctrl-Space.
 * You can use snippets with tab (example : inc<tab> -> #include <| >)
    reminder snippets are in bundle/vim-snippets/snippets
 * Bracket, char string... are auto-closed automatically
 * to insert c function with c.vim : \if, \im ... cf :h csupport

## Code tips
 * (Leader s) to deactivate / reactivate syntax verification on save (Syntastic)
 * (Leader c space) to comment
 * (Leader c u)     to uncomment
 * on command mode : maj K give you the doc of the function under cursor
 * (Leader l) to go to the corresponding tag on the tagbar (for function, fields ...)
 * + and _ allows to select and expand / shrink selection

### Syntastic
 * You can force a silent check with (Leader c) and make the error windows appear with (Leader e)
 * for syntastic to work properly in your project you may need to indicate some files to include or some flags for the compiler.
A sample file for C++ is include here : .syntastic\_cpp\_config.
This file should be next to the source file opened in vim.

CONTRIBUTE
----------

### Adding plugins
For consistency, plugins needs to be added as submodule: in bundle

 ```bash
  git submodule add [git-url]
 ```
