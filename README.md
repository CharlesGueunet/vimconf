  <leader>v to vertical split
  <leader>h to horizontal split
  <leader> + left or right to go to the dezired buffer
  <leader> + bottom to list buffers
  <leader> + top to change buffer
  <leader> + > or < to go to desired windows
  <ctrl> w + arrow to go to the dezired windows (split)
  <leadear>o to maximize/unmaximizer current windows among splitted

  <leader> b open ctags menu, allow travel btw functions & variables

# Files
  <leader> n open NerdTree : file navigator menu
  <leader> f open NerdTree on current location

# Words
  Fast travel with <leader><leader>w
  cs'" to change 'test' in "test" (change surround)
  you can add bookmark to a line with "mm"
      navigate through bookmarks with mp and mn

# Indent
  <leager>ig to have indentation guide
  To align text on a given char : :Tab/<char>
  Shorcut exist for = and : with <leader>a= (or :).
  You can fold your current scope ('{ ... }') by pressing <leader>-

# Tips
  mouse enabled, use maj when selecting text to allow ctrl-maj-c
  XML autocomplete juste write the body and then tab : p TAB -> <p></p>
  <leader>+p show your current regiser, allowing you to retrieve old pasted lines ("0p for example)

# Completion
  You can use autocompletion with tab (example : inc<tab> -> #include <| >)
  Bracket, char string... are auto-closed automatically
  to insert c function with c.vim : \if, \im ... cf :h csupport
  (:Helptags to update help)

# Code tips
  <leader>+s to deactivate / reactivate syntax verification on save (Syntastic)
  <leader>+c space to comment
  <leader>+c u     to uncomment
  for syntastic to work properly in your project you may need to indicate some files to include or some flags for the
  compiler.
  A sample file for C++ is include here : .syntastic\_cpp\_config.
  This file should be next to the source file opened in vim.
