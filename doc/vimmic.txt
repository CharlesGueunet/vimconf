1. Beginner's guide				*vimmic-beginner*

The main tool to start with this configuration is the quickmenu appearing with <F12>
The first section of this pane contains functions made to interact with the configuration.
Each of these function can be done with an action described in the |status-line|.
The next section of this pane leads to these man pages. The last section
gives access to function made to interact with the text.

Basic usage:
------------

The leader key is defined on comma.


Update:

Updating from the Git repository can be done with:

`$ git pull --recursive`

Then, you can update all your plugins inside Vim with

`:Update`

2. Vimmic configuration 		*vimmic-config*

This configuration is structured as follows:
[...]

You can customize Vimmic using two files:
 - {$HOME/|.vimrc.preconf|} to add/remove plugins and features
 - {$HOME/|.vimrc.postconf|} to configure colorscheme and plugins
Example for both of these file are given in the extra/ folder of this conf


2.1 Pre-configuration			*vimrc-preconf*

This file can be used to add or remove plugins.
To add a new plugin from a Github repository you
need to use the dein add function:

`call dein#add(maintainers/repo)`

If you want to disable a plugin fron the original configuration,
you can use the dein disable function:

`call dein#disable('repo')`

In both of the case, it is recommended to restart Vim,
apply the `:Update` command and restart again to apply your modifications.

This file also lets you disable some features of the configuration:

	let g:disable_defaultColors = 1           		disables all theming colors and words highlight defined
	let g:disable_highlightWordUnderCursor = 1		disables the current word highlight
	let g:disable_margin = 1                  		disable the 120 characters margin

Note: Use this file if you want to change you default leader key.
