==============================================================================
1. Beginner's guide				*vimmic-beginner*

The main tool to start using this configuration is the quickmenu bar. It can be
summoned using <F12>. The first section of this pane contains functions to
interact with the configuration. For each of these function the corresponding
shortcut is recalled in the 'status-line'. The next section of this pane leads
to these man pages and the last one gives access to function made to interact
with the text.


1.1 Basic usage:~
----------------

The leader key is defined on comma, look at |vimmic-preconfig| to change it.
The firsts steps to follow when starting using Vimmic is certainly to read the
|vimmic-config| section in order to create a personalized experience.


1.2 Update:~
-----------

Updating from the Git repository can be done with:

`$ git pull --recursive`

Then, you can update all your plugins inside Vim with

`:Update`


==============================================================================
2. Vimmic configuration 		*vimmic-config*

This configuration is structured as follows:
[...]

You can customize Vimmic using two files:
 - "$HOME/|.vimrc.preconf|" to add/remove plugins and features
 - "$HOME/|.vimrc.postconf|" to configure colorscheme and plugins
Example for both of these file are given in the "extra/" folder of this conf


2.1 Pre-configuration			*vimrc-preconf*~
---------------------

This optional file can be used to add or remove plugins. To add a new plugin
from a Github repository you need to use the dein add function:

`call dein#add(maintainers/repo)`

If you want to disable a plugin fron the original configuration,
you can use the dein disable function:

`call dein#disable('repo')`

In both of the case, it is recommended to restart Vim,
apply the `:Update` command and restart again to apply your modifications.

This file also lets you disable some features of the configuration:
>
	let g:disable_defaultColors = 1           		"disables all theming colors and words highlight defined
	let g:disable_highlightWordUnderCursor = 1		"disables the current word highlight
	let g:disable_margin = 1                  		"disable the 120 characters margin

Note: Use this file if you want to change you default leader key.


2.2 Post-configuration			*vimrc-postconf*~
----------------------

This optional file let you write let you write configurations for the plugins
you have added. You can also add all kind of customization, like your old
".vimrc" here.
